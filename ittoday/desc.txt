MAG/COMPASS (raw compass, offset and compassmot compensation values)	
Field	Description
MagX, MagY. MagZ	Raw magnetic field values for x, y and z axis
OfsX, OfsY, OfsZ	Raw magnetic offsets (will only change if COMPASS_LEARN parameter is 1)
MOfsX, MOfsY, MOfsZ	Compassmot compensation for throttle or current
	
CTUN (Control, Throttle and altitude information)	
FIELD	DESCRIPTION
TimeUS	Time stamp for messages (can be ignored)
ThI	The pilot’s throttle in as a number from 0 to 1000
ABst	Angle Boost: throttle increase (from 0 ~ 1000) as a result of the copter leaning over (automatically added to all pilot and autopilot throttle to reduce altitude loss while leaning)
ThO	Final throttle output sent to the motors (from 0 ~ 1000). Normally equal to ThrI+ABst while in stabilize mode.
ThH	?
DAlt	The Desired Altitude while in AltHold, Loiter, RTL or Auto flight modes. It is influenced by EKF origin, which in 3.5.X is corrected by GPS altitude. This is behaviour is turned off in 3.6.X and can be turned on with EKF_OGN_HGT_MASK.
Alt	The current EKF Altitude
BAlt	Barometer Altitude: The altitude above ground according to the barometer
DSAlt	Not used? (Only visible of Sonar is available)
SAlt	Sonar Altitude: the altitude above ground according to the sonar (Only visible of Sonar is available)
TAlt	Not used?
CRate	Climb Rate: Accelerometer + baro estimate in cm/s
DCRate	Desired Climb Rate in cm/s
CRate	Climb Rate in cm/s
	
GPA: (Global Position Accuracy)	
FIELD	DESCRIPTION
VDop	Vertical dilution of precision, a unitless measure of precisionhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_of_precision
HAcc	Horizontal Accuracy as reported by the GPS module, in meters
VAcc	Vertical Accuracy as reported by the GPS module, in meters
SAcc	Speed accuracy as reported by the GPS, in m/s/s
VV	Flag to indicate if the GPS is reporting vertical velocity
	0 No vertical velocity data 1 GPS has vertical velocity data
SMS	The autopilot time in milliseconds that the accuracy/GPS position data is associated with.
Delta	The time between when the previous GPS message and the current GPS message was parsed by the autopilot, in milliseconds

RelAlt		Accelerometer + Baro altitude in meters
Alt		GPS reported altitude (not used by the flight controller)
SPD		Horizontal ground speed in m/s
GCrs		Ground course in degrees (0 = north)
	
IMU (accelerometer and gyro information)	
FIELD	DESCRIPTION
